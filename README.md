Current PAS at railway stations is inefficient as most of the times announcements are not audible because of train noise, crowd and rush, technical defects etc. Our idea is to deliver those announcements via android application using railway Wi-Fi system and also broadcast it using a FM transmitter for a short range covering entire railway station. Using FM transmitter ensures that information reaches even to people carrying non-smart mobile devices.  Along with delivering PAS announcements, our intelligent setup will provide much more information specific to passenger’s journey by using details such as PNR (reading from SMS), Current Location etc. It’s futureproofed to broadcast any notification via our app, collecting travelers journey information (location, train speed) in case needed by railway for disaster management or public awareness.
